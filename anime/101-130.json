The monkey eats the rice ball immediately where as the crab plants the apricot seed and cares for it until it becomes a tall tree with plenty of apricot fruits.

Ookami-san's best friend is the small and high-pitched voiced Akai Ringo. Incidentally, the two are rather flat-chested, a fact the Narrator (voiced by Arai \"Kuroko\" Satomi of Railgun fame) is all too eager to point out.<br><br>\nOokami and Ringo are members of the Otogi Bank, a club in Otogi High School that assists students with their problems in return for their assistance on a different problem at a later date; thus the Otogi Bank is effectively a loan institute for problems where you can take out a loan for a solved problem but you have to repay it sooner or later.<br><br>\nThe Otogi Bank is able to solve any problem and will go to any lengths to do so, often leading the members to danger or mayhem. Since most of the members of the club are female, another male is needed for the more dangerous assignments. Thus, the scopophobic (the fear of being looked at) Morino Ryoushi is inducted as a member, right after he confesses his love for Ookami...",

In the sky above their house a giant angel is flying past. A forest has grown on the angel's back. In the forest three creatures sit around a table and playing cards. The cards are laid out and feature different images: three cards depicting babies jump down a hole in the middle of the table and begin a journey through the body of the angel. They stop in a cave where a creature plays the harp for them and turns the cards into tears. The tears fly through the air out of the angel's eyes and one of them reaches the woman's womb. In the next scene she is seen sitting at home, with her cat, contentedly stroking her own pregnant belly. The next scene is an exterior: a field with a lone tree growing on it. The man is dancing and walking towards the tree: behind the tree he finds his partner, the woman, holding a baby. They all smile at each other. <br>\n(By Tommaso Corvi-Mora)",

        "description": "Rune Balot is a down-and-out teen prostitute in Mardock City. One day, she's picked up by an ambitious casino manager named Shell who gives her everything she could want. Renewed by a false innocence, a false past, and now the false life Shell has given her, Balot feels grateful. However, she can't help but be curious about why he's done so much for her, so she does some research about his past on a computer. This turns out to be a mistake which will change her life greatly. When Shell finds out what she's done, he attempts to burn her to death by blowing up her car.<br><br>\nDue to the high crime rate in Mardock, a new law called \"Scramble 09\" has given police carte blanche to take extreme and otherwise illegal measures to revive crime witnesses. With this in mind, they allow a professor to bring Balot back from the brink of death by reassembling her entire body with reinforced synthetic fiber. When she finally wakes up, her confused mental state eventually turns toward revenge as Shell is revealed as her killer. <br><br>\n(Source: Nippon Cinema) ",

One day, however, she overhears her friends making fun of a picture book she loved and had given to one of them. She is so devastated that she decides she doesn’t need friends anymore, locks herself into the library and hasn’t taken a single step outside ever since. The God of Books sympathizes with her and gives her a Magic Quill with which she can effortlessly draw any picture and write any story she wants. Meanwhile, Hamtaro learns that Laura and her fellow students will put on \"Sunflower Taro\" as their next school play. Hamtaro and friends decide that they, too, want to try their hand at acting and prepare their own version of \"Sunflower Taro\". In the course of preparing for the play, they are suddenly sucked into a strange Picture Book Tower, where Ayayam tells them that they will be characters in her new book – a new and exciting version of the well-known fairy tale \"Sunflower Taro\". You can tell that things are getting off to an interesting start – as they always do when the Ham-Hams are involved!! <br><br>\r\n(Source: tms-e.com)",

He vows to prevent the organization from gaining immortality, and assumes his father's identity as he begins his quest for the gem. His only clues as to the gem's location are that it glows red under the full moon and that it is a doublet: a gem hidden within a larger gem. Thus, it would have to be a relatively large one with a bizarre history, and always stored in a place that never receives moonlight. He thus researches and steals famous priceless gems with odd histories from incredibly well-defended areas, and always returns them after the very next full moon. <br>",

From games of hide and seek with her friends, to playing with the bubbles in the bath or counting sheep during nap time, Penelope&rsquo;s life is never dull &ndash; even if she does wear odd socks when she gets herself dressed in the morning.<br><br>\n(Source: Anime-Planet)",

        "description": "In the middle of the 19th century, Japan was still closed off from the outside world. There were just the beginning signs of reformation in the long regime of Shogun Tokugawa.<br><br>\nIn the remote countryside, on the island of Shikoko, a young boy named Ryoma is growing up in a lower-class Samurai family. A decade later, he is to become on of the leading figures to topple the Shogun's reign and open Japan to the western world.<br><br>\nOur story begins with Ryoma, a dreaming kid of seven years. Ryoma is an honest and tenderd-hearted boy who hates any sort of violence and brutality. He is so sensitive, and a bit naive, that he often cries from pity when he sees even the simples act of violence such as another kid trampling a tiny insect. The kids and even his family call him a \"cry baby\". However, he is not a coward -- not a \"chicken\" at all. His distress comes from a desire to prevent unreasonable acts and the wrong doings in life.<br><br>\nHis older sister is the only person who understands his depth. She recognizes that her brother is gifted with a special talent and she does her best to protect him and cheer him up.<br><br>\n(Source: Enoki Films USA)",

Then there's Yuno, who's terrified of men; the Nurse, who forces other people to perform cosplay; and Hayama, Sado's best friend and a compulsive cross-dresser, who's also the girl that Sado is infatuated with. <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

Fortunately, Shuuichi has a childhood friend who shares similar feelings of gender dysphoria: the lanky tomboy Yoshino Takatsuki, who, though biologically female, does not identify as a girl. These two friends share a similar secret and find solace in one another; however, their lives become even more complicated when they must tread the unfamiliar waters of a new school, attempt to make new friends, and struggle to maintain old ones. Faced with nearly insurmountable odds, they must learn to deal with the harsh realities of growing up, gender identity, relationships, and acceptance.<br>\n<br>\nLauded as a decidedly serious take on gender identity and LGBT struggles, Takako Shimura's <i>Hourou Musuko</i> is about Shuuichi and Yoshino's journey to discover their true selves as they enter puberty, make friends, fall in love, and face real and difficult choices.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: The full version of Hourou Musuko was originally intended to be 12 episodes, but the programming block it aired on only had space for 11 episodes.

A string of droughts and other natural disasters tear the family apart, and Gusuko is forced to leave home and seek his fortunes on his own. Driven by a desire to improve the quality of life of his poor countrymen, he eventually joins a group of scientists called the Iihatov Volcano Department, and there takes part in scientific projects to fight the natural disasters that drove him from his home.<br><br>\n(Source: pelleas.net)",

        "description": "The Acorns and the Wildcat is a unique short film in picture-book format from the creator of Night on the Galactic Railroad and Gauche the Cellist. Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji's story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can't put your finger on the reason why, it's probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii's artsy 1986 feature Angel's Egg. That, and Kenji's wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki's Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji's story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji's magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art, the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.<br><br>\n(Source: pelleas.net)",

For example, the Italia Veneziano character is into pasta and women. The Deutsche (German) bishi loves potatoes and sausages, and Nippon is an otaku boy.

Which is fortunate since Hotori has no clue. Except that, unfortunately, Toshiko has no interest in working at the cafe - until she discovers that Hotori's childhood friend Hiroyuki is a regular. Which SEEMS fortunate. Except that Hotori doesn't know that, while Toshiko likes Hiroyuki, Hiroyuki secretly likes Hotori, while Hotori secretly has a crush on... No, no more spoilers! <br><br>\nBut if that's not enough drama, there's work, angst with a certain math teacher, table tennis between her classmates, her younger brother versus the school's bad girl... And yet, even though everything seems like it's going to crash at any moment, somehow Hotori's life keeps going hilariously forward. <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

In an attempt to combat the opposition's overwhelming pressure and put an end to the massive casualties, the army forms a special unit called Wyvern, or W-0, composed of former Japanese citizens referred to as \"Elevens.\" Recruited from ghettos, these young men and women pilot Knightmare frames—humanoid war machines—into dangerous operations where death awaits, hoping to make a name for themselves.\n<br><br>\nWhen a European regiment attempting to recapture a crucial city is pinned down by the enemy, it's up to W-0 to bail them out. Among those selected for the rescue operation is Lieutenant Akito Hyuuga, known as \"Hannibal's Ghost\" due to his prowess on the battlefield. However, the supposed rescue mission becomes suicidal when, in an attempt to take out as many Britannians as possible, the commanding officer initiates the Knightmare's self-destruct sequence. In its aftermath, Akito finds that he is the last one standing…\n<br><br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite) <br><br>\n<i>Note: The film received a special pre-screening on July 16, 2012 at theatres in Shinjuku Ward 9 and Ikebukuro Cinema Sunshine.

Unfortunately, negative karma cannot simply be destroyed, it must be atoned for. However the leader of the powerful mystic Buddhist Fuze Clan plans to stop the destruction of the negative karma which will end up creating the nine-headed Naaga and destroy the world if not the whole universe. To help in stopping the creation of the Naaga, the clan summons a Shinto god known as Susano, the Warrior God of Destruction. The powerful, arrogant, and homicidal god faces challenges. These include the Empire and the clan leader's own daughter, the bratty sorceress Seska, who is possessed by the power of the negative Karma and a powerful magic formula.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Even if the luscious Princess Lala is finally starting to admit her real feelings for her earthling scum significant other, there are so many other things constantly going wrong that Riko’s doing well just to survive.<br>\n<br>\nWhether it’s due to bounty hunters, a defective transporter, body switches, alien skunks, mighty morphing power bathrooms, a sleepover that goes horribly, horribly wrong, or, that worst galactic scourge of all, Valentine’s Day, each day seems determined to prove why you should never, ever, marry a monster from outer space!<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

Koyomi Araragi, a second year high school student at Naoetsu High School, befriends Tsubasa Hanekawa, the top honors student at his school. Hanekawa mentions a rumor about a \"blonde vampire\" that has been sighted around their town recently. Araragi, who is usually anti-social, takes a liking to her down-to-earth personality.\n<br><br>\nThat night, Araragi encounters the rumored vampire: she is Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, also known as the \"iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded King of Apparitions.\" The stunningly beautiful vampire cries out for Koyomi to save her as she lies in a pool of her own blood, all four of her limbs cut off. Kiss-shot asks Araragi to give her his blood, and when he does, the next moment he awakes, Araragi finds himself reborn as her vampire kin. As Araragi struggles to accept his existence, Kiss-Shot whispers, \"Welcome to the world of darkness...\"\n<br><br>\n(Source: Aniplex)",

Thus in 1998 a new TV series of VIFAM was broadcasted in memory of him. Televised 1998/3/21-1998/10/3 (in Kansai area), it contains 26 episodes, and like Twelve people disappeared it is a sidestory, but some new features are added: new persons, new RV, etc.<br><br>\nThe story could be inserted between #22 and #26 (#24 and #25 are digests) of VIFAM, and is divided into three parts: Act I (#1-14), Interlude (#15-18), Act II (#19-26), if we name them (in reality Act I and II have little relationship). It could also be the New Testament, but it is now regarded as an apocrypha (or worse, a pseudo-VIFAM). There are several reasons to say so, but to watch the story is the best way to understand them.<br><br>\n(Source: u-netsurf.ne.jp/~suemura/vifam/vguide.html)",

Discovering the remnants of an old beach store, the entire group strips to swimsuits and sets out to make the uninhabited island inhabitable, but they're unaware that this seeming paradise is actually just the dead calm before the storm. Because sometimes the recently deceased aren't the only problems that can lie buried in the sand, and as the swimwear comes off and the inhibitions come down, a kink in the island's food chain sets a truly shocking series of events into motion! You won't believe what comes out next, but suffice it to say that the deserted island may not be so deserted after all!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: An unaired episode bundled with the seventh volume of the manga.</i>",

They wonder who Dr. Junod was and what he did. Just then they are bathed in a strange light and transported back to Europe, more than 70 years before.<br><br>\nIt is 1935. The young Dr. Junod, who has been working in a hospital in Mulhouse, France, is heading to Ethiopia as a delegate of the ICRC. Time travelers Mii and Yuko set off along Dr. Junod's path of hardship and turmoil. In Ethiopia, Dr. Junod witnesses attacks on Red Cross workers and the use of poison gas. One after another people are felled. The young doctor sees firsthand the horrors of war, but buoyed by an indomitable spirit he willingly offers a helping hand to those who are suffering as a result of the war.<br><br>\nDr. Junod's work takes him from Ethiopia to Spain and across the European battlefields of World War II. He works to improve the treatment of prisoners of war and arranges prisoner exchanges. He establishes a method for prisoners and their families to write to each other. He secures routes for the delivery of relief supplies. As a humanitarian, Dr. Junod offers moral support to the weak. Seeing that, Mii and Yuko reflect on their own lives and problems.<br><br>\n(Source: official website)",

Concerned about the possible effects of the completion of Big X, Dr. Asagumo intentionally delays the progress of the research, conspiring with his co-researcher, the devious Dr. Engel. Immediately before Germany is defeated by the Allies, Dr. Asagumo implants a card inscribed with the secret of Big X in his son, Shigeru, and is then shot to death by the German army. Twenty years later, the card is discovered in the body of Shigeru, who is then living in Tokyo. Soon, an organization claiming alliance with the Nazis appears, steals the card, and completes the Big X project. Dr. Engel's grandson has joined the Nazi Alliance. The completed Big X is then revealed to be a drug that can expand the human body without limitation. Recovering Big X from the enemy, Shigeru's son Akira fearlessly challenges the Nazi Alliance and Hans Engel, who are plotting to conquer the world.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: Most of the series is lost media.

It wasn&rsquo;t until recently that they realized that they had feelings for each other that were much more than friends. While working in a PC Software company as a salesman, Kensuke is told to work at another branch due to a shortage of manpower. The big catch here is that he won&rsquo;t be able to live at his apartment anymore so that he can easily commute to his new job.<br><br>\nThat being said, he won&rsquo;t be able to see Ayumu for a very long time, but she&rsquo;s been sweet enough to watch over his apartment while he&rsquo;s gone. Well, you know what they say about long distance relationships; after a good amount of time has passed, Kensuke is in a mixture of loneliness and paranoia. He&rsquo;s missing Ayumu, but also doubting why a woman like her would stick around for a guy like him. To add more confusion to the fire he&rsquo;s come across four women around his new work that give him more temptation that he can bare.<br>\n<br>\nWill our hero hold out for love, or will he give into the pressures?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: White Masq)",

All they must do is sign a contract with Kyubey and agree to take on the duty to fight abstract beings called 'witches' that spread despair to the human world, and in return, each one of them will be granted any single wish they desire. However, as Homura's omen suggests, there might be far more to becoming a magical girl than Madoka and Sayaka realize... <br>\n<br>\n<i>Notes:<br>\n- Due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the broadcasts of episodes 11 and 12 were delayed and were later aired as a double feature on April 21, 2011.</i>",

This work is a mixture of traditional cel-based animation, 3-D animation and 2-D computer graphics techniques, each with it's own history and production standards.

However, the crudeness of the artifact has led to the artifact being rejected for every museum in China and abroad, and thus, unwilling to destroy it, the artifact was set on a barge, continuously moving along the Yangtze River. The story continues on to Mak-zi's descendant 18 generations later, McDull (Kwok Kwan Yin), a kindergartener living in Hong Kong.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

        "description": "Kaito Daimon would be a completely average high school student except for one thing: he's a 'demon' at solving puzzles. Kaito is so brilliant, in fact, that when he's asked to take some 'special' tests of his unique ability, he immediately suspects that the test itself is a test. Kaito suddenly finds himself caught up in a lethal Philosopher's Puzzle made by the sinister group POG, a murderous maze of trap upon trap, where failing to solve the secret correctly will result in death! Fortunately, Kaito's skills prove up to the first test, both for himself and his childhood friend Nanoha, who is also caught up in the deadly scheme. But now that he has been designated as a Solver, he is pulled into a new life where he must travel the world with other Solvers, attempting to solve the latest deadly riddles left by POG. There's a new conundrum around every corner and each deception could lead to death, but once a riddle has been posed, you can count on Kaito to unfold, unravel and unlock it!<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Ten years in the making and entirely, single-handedly rendered in colored pencil, Kurosaka's fantastical labor of love is a marvel to behold. Emerging from the staggering detail and craft flooding every frame is the story of a young woman who sets out to engineer a dream-food that can put an end to the world's famine. Synthesizing Frederic Back's subtle, haptic textures with Bill Plympton's frenetic mutations and David Lynch's haunting wormholes, Kurosaka&rsquo;s work still retains its own singular, luminous potency.<br><br>\n(Source: Los Angeles Animation Festival summary)",

There's a playful surrealist sensibility to Kago's work, as well as a tendency to revel in the ridiculous, the crude and the disturbing. His work straddles a weird boundary between avant-garde experimentation and low-brow fart jokes &mdash; the punchline of one of these films is literally an oozing torrent of shit &mdash; although, admittedly, his videos seem to lean a bit more heavily towards the fart jokes than his comics. But hey, who doesn't appreciate a good fart joke once in a while?<br><br>\n(Source: 'Only the Cinema' blog)",

        "description": "This work was submitted in a special animation competition as part of a PR project for a power company, but was unfortunately not adopted. The reason is very clear: the setting of the story is the exhausted earth. There couldn't be a more instructive setting for a power company that uses enormous amounts of the earth's resources. Additionally, a girl robot discovered by the main character can store sunlight and convert it into energy; in other words, the robot does not require a power-generating company. In addition to this, the robot destroys herself to protect the established solar power generation system in space. <br><br>\nThe unsuccessful outcome of the competition for Tezuka Osamu was only natural, and it is clear that he created this piece, as it was intentionally, as he managed everything from the original story to the screenplay, animation, narration, etc., all the while knowing that the competition was sponsored by a power company. <br><br>\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)",

The Phoenix chooses a story entitled \"Old Woman\" (\"Oba-chan\") from numerous episodes of \"Black Jack\" to discuss the theme of how much love can grow in this short lifetime. In the story, there is a seemingly greedy old woman who is always asking her daughter-in-law for money, and her son and his wife become fed up with the old woman's behaviour. Naturally, there are constant quarrels in the family, and their quiet ordinary life seems to have been lost. <br><br>\nAfter accidentally coming to know the family, Black Jack learns that the old woman had her young son, who was dying at the time, treated and saved by a noted doctor who claimed a great amount of money. She has, in fact, been paying for the treatment over some tens of years. Because of her great love for her son, the old woman devoted her entire life to paying for the treatment. <br><br>\nNot aware of his mother's act, the son feels helplessly hammered and squeezed by his mother and his wife. But when he finally comes to know the truth, he is deeply impressed with the love of his mother, who valued her son's life more than her own. Black Jack asks him if he could love her just as much as she loved him. Explaining that only love valued more highly than life can live forever, the Phoenix then tells a story about the move of the capital to Heian, which was a great national project and an attempt to infuse a city with eternal life.<br><br>\n(Source: official site)",

In spite of that, the wealthy Einzbern family is confident that the Fourth Holy Grail War will be different; namely, with a vessel of the Holy Grail now in their grasp. Solely for this reason, the much hated \"Magus Killer\" Kiritsugu Emiya is hired by the Einzberns, with marriage to their only daughter Irisviel as binding contract.\n<br><br>\nKiritsugu now stands at the center of a cutthroat game of survival, facing off against six other participants, each armed with an ancient familiar, and fueled by unique desires and ideals. Accompanied by his own familiar, Saber, the notorious mercenary soon finds his greatest opponent in Kirei Kotomine, a priest who seeks salvation from the emptiness within himself in pursuit of Kiritsugu.\n<br><br>\nBased on the light novel written by Gen Urobuchi, <i>Fate/Zero</i> depicts the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War—10 years prior to <i>Fate/stay night</i>. Witness a battle royale in which no one is guaranteed to survive.\n<br><br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)\n<br><br>\n<i>Note: The first episode aired with a runtime of ~48 minutes as opposed to the standard 24 minute long episode.</i>",

Just one touch makes his nose bleed, so school's a bloody nightmare even before Kanade, the Principal's twisted daughter, deduces both Kinjiro's \"feminine issue\" AND that his name contains the sounds \"Chi\" and \"Kin\" back to back. But Chi-Kin's female troubles don't totally redline until a wrong turn in the men's room exposes the secret Subaru, Kanade's manservant, has been hiding in the water closet. (Well, to be fair, we should say WOmanservant.) And if Subaru's cross reactions concerning her cross-dressing aren't enough of a drag, Kinjiro's girl problems also include a haunted martial artist (with ghosts); a cat-eared fetishist (meow!); AND his own sister, whose interest in \"wrestling\" a certain incorrectly packaged butler may result in an unexpected ending! And that's JUST the set up! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

The Republic of Biscotti, a union of dog-like citizens, has come under attack by the feline forces of the Galette Leo Knights. In an effort to save Biscotti, Princess Millhiore summons a champion from another world in order to defend her people. That champion is Cinque Izumi, a normal junior high student from Earth.<br>\n<br>\nAgreeing to assist Biscotti, Cinque retrieves a sacred weapon called the Palladion and prepares for war. In Flonyard, wars are fought with no casualties and are more akin to sports competitions with the goal of raising money for the participating kingdoms. Cinque is successful in his role as Biscotti’s champion, but learns that a summoned champion cannot be returned to their home world. The scientists of Biscotti will endeavor to find a way for Cinque to return home, but until they figure something out, he must serve Princess Millhiore by continuing to fight as Biscotti’s hero.",

In Kawakami City, having a samurai ancestor and enormous 'fighting spirit' isn't just an interesting fact, it's a huge part of how you end up being ranked on the social totem pole. That, in turn, rolls over into the school curriculum. Fortunately, that's something the local kids like Yamato Naoe have learned to deal with by forming into small 'bands,' (that's the samurai type, NOT music). However, while the delicate sexual balance of Yamato's group seemed fine when there were three girls and four boys, the sudden addition of two MORE girls starts to send everything spinning out of control! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

Years later, her brother Kou finds their father’s picture album, and as he flips through its pages, the pictures remind Fuu of all the happy memories of her father that she will carry with her forever.<br>\n<br>\nNow, as the shy Fuu enters her first year of high school, she once again takes up her father’s old camera, determined to take wonderful pictures that will bring joy and happiness to others.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Nozomi Entertainment)",

He takes him as his own child, much to the surprise of his family. As he discovers he can talk (although not perfectly), walk, and do magic, and he causes havoc for Michio with his powers. Like Nobita Nobi from Doraemon (Another manga series from Abiko's friend Fujiko F Fujio), Michio does bad at work and is clumsy, so things go worse when it comes to UB's mischief, even though he's only a baby. The manga and anime tells the story of the duo and their adventures.",

Now, as the invaders pace behind the northern borders, coveting the small kingdom's magic and high technology, Liberl slowly rebuilds with the aid of the Bracer's Guild, whose mystical use of \"Craft\" is even more intrinsic to the nation's defense than its own army. For young Estelle Bright, daughter of Cassius, this is all just ancient history that she and her adopted brother Joshua learned as kids. But history has a way of repeating itself, and as they prepare to join the Bracers Guild themselves, sinister forces are preparing to thrust them into the familiar family situation of being in the worst possible place when mayhem breaks out. Because when their father's airship goes suddenly missing, of course it only makes sense for two green, but extraordinarily capable, young teenagers to strike out on a rescue mission of their own! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

But the girls' journey is far from just fun and games: hard work, sweat, and tears are some of the prerequisites needed to flourish in this industry—and for 765 Pro in particular, a watchful eye out for their rival, the infamous 961 Production.\n\nAs the girls' fame grows, however, their time together as a family diminishes, and now the very popularity they sought is threatening to tear them apart. A difficult balance of work and bonding must be achieved, or they risk everyone going their separate ways. The personal and professional ordeals of these idols can't be conquered alone, but with each other's loving support, any obstacle or hardship can be overcome!",

However, following the premature loss of her father, she has to move with her mother to the old family house on a remote island. Here, time seems to have stopped: old wooden buildings, holy shrines surrounded by trees, fields painstakingly carved out from steep hills... and no shopping mall. <br><br>\nNeedless to say, Momo is not too overenthusiastic about this new environment. Most of all, her heart is still feeling uneasy about an unfinished letter left by her father. A letter that contained only two words: \"Dear Momo...\" <br><br>\nWhat was dad going to say? <br><br>\nOne day, exploring the attic of her new big house, Momo finds a dusty and worn out book. And from that moment, something really unexpected starts happening around her... <br><br>\n(Source: Production I.G Official Website) ",

So when the decision is made to merge the elite Yuihime Girls' Private Academy and the coeducational Kagamidai Private Academy, everyone wants to take extra care in avoiding trouble while bringing the two Privates together. Therefore, rather than just sticking the Kagamidai boys into the Yuihime girls all at once, a plan is concocted in which a group of test males will be inserted into the Girls' Private Academy first. <br><br>\nThus it is that poor young Shingo finds himself being thrown as a sacrificial lamb to the lionesses of Yuihime, who aren't exactly waiting for him with open arms. Will Shingo manage to survive the estrogen soaked death pit that is Yuihime? Can the girls learn to be more receptive to the boys? And just how long until something involving panties will cause emotions to flare, sparks to fly and the battle of the sexes to explode? <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

In order to find a way to return to outer space, the humans began reenacting human history according to the Holy book Testament. But in the year 1413 of the Testament Era, the nations of the pocket dimensions invade and conquer Japan, dividing the territory into feudal fiefdoms and forcing the original inhabitants of Japan to leave. <br><br>\nIt is now the year 1648 of the Testament Era, the refugees of Japan now live in the city ship Musashi, where it constantly travels around Japan while being watched by the Testament Union, the authority that runs the re-enactment of history. However, rumors of an apocalypse and war begins to spread when the Testament stops revealing what happens next after 1648. <br><br>\nTaking advantage of this situation, Toori Aoi, head of Musashi Ariadust Academy's Supreme Federation and President of the student council, leads his fellow classmates to use this opportunity to regain their homeland. <br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The game promises him a chance at winning the heart of a beautiful girl, so Hiroshi presses \"Yes\" to begin...only to have the screen turn to static right in front of him. <br><br>\nSkip to the next day. Hiroshi starts telling his friends about this game, and they aren't sure what to believe. But right then, in the middle of the class, a huge electrical storm hits, leaving in its wake a lone white egg. When Hiroshi touches it, the egg opens, revealing a beautiful (and stark naked) green-haired girl. <br><br>\nThis girl, Hiroko, gives Hiroshi the name Zenon and gives him all sorts of powers, including ESP. That's all well and good, but right afterwards all the way to the very end, Hiroshi/Zenon winds up battling all sorts of evil bad guys and huge meanies non-stop to protect his new sweetheart.<br><br>\n(Source: Animerate)",

The main character, who is the student president of the high school, has another hidden persona. The persona as head of the &ldquo;Gang Rape Club&rdquo;...<br>\n<br>\nA dark ceremony existed that had been handed down for thousands of years in the old town of Rinin; the name of the ceremony, in particular, in the oldest of records. That ceremony, enacted to protect the region from disease and crop failure as a curse from the region's guardian deity, Hime Iwanaga, occurs in the evenings between the new moon and full moon, in which a maiden is disguised as Konohanasakuyabime and gangraped to appease Hime Iwanaga's anger. In regards to the maiden, there must be an important man participating in the gang rape, in other words, that man must be related in blood to their wife or lover, mother or daughter, younger sister or older sister, and the like, and after the gang rape, if a pregnancy occurs, Hime Iwanaga's anger is abated, and a good harvest and safety upon the region will be promised. However, if a pregnancy does not occur for the sake of suppressing Hime Iwanaga's anger, the maiden is supposed to be covered with semen, and floated down the river alive, as a sacrifice.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now---After the Tashio era, the ceremony itself had vanished into the dark history, but had still continued on at Rinin High School; the cruel, improper traditions being inherited over into a secret society through actions carried out by the Gang Rape Club. For generations, the student president of the High School has served as the head of the Gang Rape Club, not allowing even one day to pass uneventfully, submerging numerous women to the dark, suffocating pleasure.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Visual Novel Database)",

The protagonist later realizes that during midnight when the channel is on, his body can phase into his television set as a gateway to enter another world infested with shadows. <br><br>\r\nAfter discovering this, they all decide to explore. When first completely entering the world, dazed and confused, Narukami meets Teddie. Mayonaka TV and the town murders seem to have a connection. The murder victims may be merely victims of Mayonaka TV. Everyone decides that they will together try to solve the mysterious murders by exploring the hidden world of Mayonaka TV.",

One such group calls themselves SIRRUT. They have decided to take on Fumito Nanahara, a man who has great influence on the political world, and basically controls Tokyo with an iron fist. While using the internet as a weapon to discover more information about Fumito, they learn about \"Tower\", the secret organization behind Fumito which engages in human experimentation.<br><br>\nWhen members of Surat attempt to set up an ambush in the subway to expose the truth behind \"Tower\", mysterious creatures suddenly appear and attack the passengers. During this crisis, Saya appears - a young girl who uses a Japanese blade to slay the Old Ones. The same Saya who lost everything dear to her in that horrifying incident in Ukishima Province. What sort of \"experiment\" is Fumito and \"Tower\" trying to conduct using the Old Ones? And can Saya finally deliver vengeance to Fumito?<br><br>\nNow, the final battle begins...<br><br>\n(Source: Official site)",

It's a provisional resurrection, however, and it comes at a price: to keep Himari alive they need to find the mysterious Penguin Drum.

While he really likes eroge, he can't draw, isn't much of a writer or composer, and doesn't know much about business. Still, his dream is to get a job at an eroge studio in hopes of creating what he loves, eroge.<br>\n<br>\nTomoya's luck takes a turn for the better when he sees a help wanted ad for the local studio Flower, and after a meeting with the company president (who to his surprise looks like an elementary school kid), manages to get a job as administrator of the company's website. Tomoya's glee at being part of the eroge industry is short-lived, as he soon learns that Flower is on the chopping block due to their first title being a massive failure.<br>\n<br>\nAfter playing through Flower's first title, Tomoya realizes that his co-workers don't know anything about eroge, lacking the insight and understanding needed to make a good game. After some nudging from the president of Flower's parent company and some soul searching of his own, our protagonist takes it upon himself to save Flower by teaching the four girls on staff the ins and outs of what makes an eroge good. The story thus focuses on Tomoya's role as a psuedo-consultant while getting to know the four heroines of the story as the player is given an interesting look at the world of eroge development.",

Ako and Mephisto tried to establish contact with Major Land, but could not get a response.<br>\nFull of worry, Hibiki and the others headed to Major Land, where there was no sign of the former land of overflowing music. The world was desolate without sound, its people devoid of emotion like stone, continuing to play their soundless instruments. The only one left was Ako's friend Suzu, who explained how Aphrodite suddenly changed and took away all music from the land. Ako and Mephisto, unbelieving and determined to find out the truth, headed to the palace where Aphrodite was. Hibiki, Kanade and Ellen decided to chase after Suzu, who had run away after Ako refused to believe her story.<br><br>\nWhile chasing after Suzu, the girls met with 3 men eager to steal the Healing Chest. And as the truth slowly came to light, the Pretty Cure had to face up to the real enemy.",

        "description": "Dame Oyaji is the story of Damesuke Amano, a hapless office worker who faces a tremendous amount of bullying on the job and especially at home, where he has (contrary to traditional Japanese notions of family) absolutely no power or say in the runnings of the household whatsoever.<br><br>\nAmano lives with his wife, Onibaba, his beautiful teenaged daughter Yukiko, and his grade-schooler son Takobo. Onibaba is an imposing, violent heifer of a woman who regularly berates and even physically assaults her husband and who enjoys nothing more than making his life miserable; Yukiko and Takobo frequently join in physically and psychologically abusing their father. <br><br>\nThe original manga is said to have been quite shocking to early 1970s Japan, in which the father was often still traditionally regarded as the head of the household.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

        "description": "Before producing a TV series, a pilot film was made to let sponsors and television stations grasp the work's pervasive quality. This is the pilot film for \"Dororo\" in which the characters are closer to those of the original story compared to the characters in the TV series. The faces and personalities of the characters in the TV series are altered from time to time to gain popularity among its viewers. As a result, sometimes viewers really loved it, but at other times it didn't go over as well. The pilot for \"Dororo\" was made in color, but the TV series was monochrome due to a tighter budget. The story depicts a journey in which the boy thief named Dororo and a cursed man called Hyakkimaru destroy monsters. Hyakkimaru can be a complete \"human\" only after he destroys 48 devils.<br><br>\n(Source: Official site)",

He then received a helmet (that also serves as a mask) that gives superhuman strength, a cape that enables the wearer to fly, and a badge that allows him to breathe underwater and communicate with his fellow comrades whom he met soon after he utilized these gifts. Superman made it clear to all Permans that their identity must be kept a secret or their brain will be destroyed should it ever be revealed and they are given a special doppelganger robot that can replace them while they are away to achieve this feat, although it is not entirely foolproof nor is it free from potential problems. These equipments then allowed them to be young Permans who try to maintain peace and help the people who are in need.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

However, after graduating, these teammates, known as \"The Generation of Miracles\", go their separate ways and now consider each other as rivals.\n<br><br>\nAt Seirin High School, two newly recruited freshmen prove that they are not ordinary basketball players: Taiga Kagami, a promising player returning from the US, and Tetsuya Kuroko, a seemingly ordinary student whose lack of presence allows him to move around unnoticed. Although Kuroko is neither athletic nor able to score any points, he was a member of Teikou's basketball team, where he played as the \"Phantom Sixth Man,\" who easily passed the ball and assisted his teammates.\n<br><br>\n<i>Kuroko no Basket</i> follows the journey of Seirin's players as they attempt to become the best Japanese high school team by winning the Interhigh Championship. To reach their goal, they have to cross pathways with several powerful teams, some of which have one of the five players with godlike abilities, whom Kuroko and Taiga make a pact to defeat.\n<br><br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",
