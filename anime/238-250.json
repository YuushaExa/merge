Outside is where crime and corruption runs wild where no one trusts anyone. Between those two areas is a massive canal that separates the two and is spanned by a single bridge. The way this town is constructed, is a realization of what human discrimination looks like.\n<br><br>\nSonia is a young, female detective who has just moved from Upper Town to Outside for work, chasing after a few cases. That is when she meets three hideous beings who fight to protect humanity. ‘Just what are they…?’ she wonders...\n<br><br>\nThese three monsters known as youkai ningen (demon humans) live, concealing who they really are, while each bearing their own feelings and thoughts. BEM wants to become human himself and fights against evil that would befall humans. Bela looks up to and desires to become human herself and attends school in order to understand humans better. Belo has dove headfirst into the world of gaming, taking a philosophical view of both humans and the world. With every incident, they come into contact with humans, get hurt, and worry. They fight for the sake of humanity, however, due to their horrible form, they are something that humans will never accept.\n<br><br>\nThere is another who is searching for these three beings. She has her thumb on the concealed assembly that controls Libra City from the shadows. But just what is her goal as she tries to get her hands on these three? \n<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

Though born to a wealthy family in Izumozaki, Ryoukan chooses to abandon the easy life he would have inherited in order to understand the true meaning of life through the teachings of Buddhism. From his early adulthood, he undergoes a series of harsh training that demands a solitary and meager lifestyle. Throughout it all, he remains an extremely modest and humble person, a true humanitarian who accepts every individual for who they are while rejecting all worldly fame and wealth. Ryoukan found true peace in life through nature and spending time with children. His pure mind and affable personality have captivated many, and his legacy and the wisdom of his teachings live on today.\n<br><br>\n(Source: ATTKC)",

Walking home after wrapping up the enrollment procedure at their new school, they noticed a large truck stopped outside of their house. Since they had already moved everything in, they wondered what it was doing there. They found the door unlocked and nervously went upstairs worried that there might be a burglar. Instead they found a girl pushing a giant piano with all her might… while in her underwear. They stood dumbfounded at the absurd sight. Why was there a half-naked girl in their house? Soon she noticed them and yelled at them to get out. A few minutes later, she came out in a beautiful dress.<br>\n<br>\n“I am deeply sorry for my earlier actions. My name is Ruria Fondina. I have come here to live with you as family.”<br>\n<br>\nShe was a princess from a certain island nation. That was only the beginning as many other princesses showed up at their door one by one!<br>",

It's also the way that earns the most points and sets up yet another way to score, a conversion. Riku Haruma, who played rugby when he was younger, has a conversion of his own when he sees the school's struggling team practicing on field. Although he's not big enough to keep up with powerful players like Akira Kariya, Riku has far more experience and, when a bit of offered advice causes an immediate improvement, Riku realizes that what the team really needs is leadership.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

There, they'll experience the everyday travails of being heroes, for the first time without the support of their instructors or chaperons.

Cut off from any backup and facing their greatest threat yet, it's up to Deku, Bakugo, and their classmates to face unspeakable danger to protect not only the people of the island, but the future of all Hero society.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

But while heading home, the timid girl brightens up when she encounters a boy who looks exactly like her first love—a prince from a shoujo manga. Subsequently, she finds herself in a peculiar situation with the mature Akari Yamamoto, a new neighbor who immediately befriends her.<br>\n<br>\nNow attending the same high school together, Yuna shows interest in Akari's brother Rio—the same mysterious and handsome boy she met during spring break. Likewise, Akari is falling for Yuna's carefree childhood friend, Kazuomi Inui. However, love is not at anyone's fingertips, as the relationship between these four contrasting friends faces complications, preventing them from moving forward. To discover the truth between them, they will need to confront their own struggles and uncover secrets hidden among themselves.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

It was bugs on an entirely different kind of scale: bizarre insects that mutate their victims into half-human creatures that rapidly evolve into rampaging giant monsters!<br>\n<br>\nYet, as unstoppable as the monstrous insects seemed, humanity is as hard to kill as cockroaches, and exterminators like Kidou now spend their lives stalking and killing the creatures called Cagasters. As the brief still-partially human phase is the best time to strike, however, exterminators soon learn to distance themselves, socially and emotionally, from normal people. But when Kidou finds himself suddenly tasked with returning a young survivor to her mother, he starts to realize that his emotions and humanity may not be buried as deeply as he believed!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Fortunately, someone has called the fire department, and they are speedily able to rescue her. In a strange twist of fate, one of the firefighters turns out to be her childhood friend, Souma Mizuno. Although she was once interested in him, her crush was short-lived due to Souma's infamous womanizing ways.<br>\n<br>\nBut with Ryou left homeless and all her possessions lost, Souma opens his home to her. Moving in with her childhood friend means Ryou has to build boundaries—physical ones—because to cross them means to jump straight into Souma's lustful arms. But due to his persistent interest in her, Ryou realizes he might just reignite the burning flames of passion between them. <br>\n<br>\n(Source: Ascendant Animation)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: The complete edition with explicit scenes was distributed web via Comic Festa Anime Zone.

        "description": "In a post-apocalyptic future that has been torn apart by shadowy creatures known as the Earless, humanity's heroes are the Players, who pilot mecha known as Equipment to battle their inhuman enemies while earning fame and fortune to boot. Echo is a young tech-head who dreams of working amongst the Players and their Equipment, going so far as to build a makeshift mecha of his own, but he has long since resigned himself to life in the destitute scrap-heaps that cover so much of the world, now. That is, until he discovers an amnesiac named μ (or “Mu”) who has a mechanical port in her back that is the telltale sign of a Player. The pair become fast friends, and they vow to use their skills to fight for the world and defeat The Earless.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

The SUEI had a major weapon for the fight - Shinkalions, bullet trains that can transform into giant mecha. One boy, Hayato Hayasugi, was a huge fan of trains and stumbled upon his father’s secret work for the SUEI. Surprisingly, Hayato soon became a Shinkalion driver! As perhaps Japan’s best chance of survival, Hayato and other kids take on the great responsibility of fighting otherworldly enemies. <br> <br>\n\nNow, a new giant enemy has come from space looking to conquer the planet. Although the SUEI have a new prototype Shinkalion known as the ALFA-X to take up the fight, Hayato’s father, Hokuto, disappears. A 9-year-old version of Hokuto leaps through time to the present to help fight the alien attackers and drives the ALFA-X! <br><br>\n\n(Source: Tokyo Otaku Mode)",

Elder Tama asks for Kokoro's help in helping humans realize the value of their items instead of so easily tossing them away. But Tepple had snuck into the Cocotama world with the others and taken a key acorn which unlocks the Happy Tree that contains Happy Stars, the source of magic for their world. Elder Tama found out it was missing and the Cocotama gang try to track it down. He says that mushrooms are appearing on tossed away items that as they are born from the feelings of sadness, and they emit a negative energy that effects both humans and Cocotama.

Produced by Space Neko Company (which animated Pop Team Story segments and some of short sketches in the TV series), Mikako Komatsu and Ryusei Nakao reprised their role as Popuko in the first and second halves respectively, and so did Sumire Uesaka and Norio Wakamoto as Pipimi.

It's the return of the cutting-edge zombie idol anime! One day, Minamoto Sakura lost her life in an unfortunate accident. Then, ten years later… After Sakura wakes up in a strange mansion, mysterious idol producer Tatsumi Kotaro tells her that she will be joining a group of legendary girls to form an idol unit. The seven girls are charged with a quest to save the fading Saga Prefecture and adopt the group name Franchouchou. After overcoming the difficulties stemming from their different ages and different periods of history, their undead zombie bodies allow them to defy expectations of what idols can be. During the final winter of the Heisei era they performed their first featured concert at Karatsu's Furusato Exhibition Hall, Arpino, taking another step towards becoming a legend. Now, in the modern Reiwa Era… The curtain rises on a new chapter in the story of Franchouchou, as they march towards a bright future full of hope.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

On the anniversary of this sacrifice, Barone and Clackey hold a conference, celebrating the union of Mazoku and humanity, and also Dan's feats. <br><br>\n\nHowever, beneath that peace, an organization named Cardinal Sign advocates for the subjugation of Mazoku and human supremacy. They resort to terrorist attacks, violence, and have somehow obtained the 12 Zodiac X-Rares which ought to have vanished together with Dan. <br><br>\n\nAmidst all this chaos, the core bearers feel a weird sensation, one they recognize before. What could be the meaning of it, and what is the meaning behind the card that appeared within their decks, named \"The Clash King's Miracle\"? <br><br>",

Having no skill, money, or even a full set of drums, a feared trio of high school delinquents nevertheless decide they are destined for musical glory in a quest to impress their only friend Aya, avoid a rival gang, and – most importantly – jam out. Animated almost entirely by director Kenji Iwaisawa, and featuring a lead performance by Japanese alt-rock legend Shintaro Sakamoto, <i>ON-GAKU: OUR SOUND</i> brings its own sound and vision to the Hiroyuki Oohashi manga from which it was adapted. With pitch-perfect deadpan humor, the film presents a highly original take on the beloved slacker comedy: a lo-fi buddy film with a blaring musical finale that will leave you wanting an immediate encore.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: GKIDS)",

The MV uses imagery to reflect the TV anime's theme of ghost sweeping and also splices in some live-action shots of the Oresama duo themselves. Unlike the first 3 music videos of their career, with character designs and animation solely done by Utomaru, this music video employed 26 other artists and animators to achieve the final product.",

        "description": "Suzu is a quiet and ordinary -- if not a bit of clumsy and daydreaming -- girl growing up in the outskirts of the city of Hiroshima in mid-1930s. She loves drawing sketches with pencils -- a hobby she is really good at. Following her parents' arrangement in 1943, 18-year-old Suzu is married to a young man living in Kure, a neighboring city with a large naval base, in which he works as a civilian secretary for the military tribunal. There she faces a new life, a new family, as well as many new challenges and hardships, particularly with the worsening life conditions due to the Pacific War. Yet Suzu manages to find happiness and peace in her daily life. \n\nThe concept behind the film is to give the perspective of \"several more lives\" in addition to Suzu's, so it has a new title to reflect the new theme. It will adapt more scenes from the manga.\n<br><br>\nThe new scenes include Suzu crossing paths with Rin in the fall of 1944 and the winter and spring of 1945. Rin features prominently in the new visual above and the video below. Another new segment will focus on the Makurazaki Typhoon of September 1945, while Suzu is worried for her younger sister Sumi.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Out in public, he's considered the perfect prince, but on the inside, he is naggy and calls others \"incompetents.\" One day while he was not doing his usual perfect newscaster persona, he is reunited with the visual artist Tsuzuki Ushio, whom he had interviewed very recently. Luckily, it doesn't appear as though Tsuzuki had recognized him because he was wearing a tracksuit and a mask. Kei tells Tsuzuki that his name is \"Owari\" and ends up in a situation where he has to help Tsuzuki out with his work.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
