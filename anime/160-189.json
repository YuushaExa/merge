Traveling to Tanegashima, Daichi quickly finds himself involved with the machinations of Globe, a secret agency created to defend mankind from extraterrestrial forces. And while it might seem like a big job for a mere teenager, it turns out that the skills Daichi has honed on video games, combined with a special weapon called the Livlaster, make Daichi ideally suited for operating the Earth Engine Impacter, a giant robot that may be Mankind's best hope against aliens whose goal is to completely drain our world's lifeforce energy. Fortunately, Daichi won't be on his own, as he's quickly joined by a group of equally dedicated young people who all have their own skills and abilities to contribute to the battle.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Unable to fight a pandemic enemy that turns defenders into adversaries, the shocked remnants of the human race are forced to retreat into cities surrounded by giant monoliths made of Varanium, one of the few materials that can stop the Gastrea. Now mankind's last hope lies in the Cursed Children: young girls infected with the virus who have managed to retain a hold on their humanity. Paired with a partner, they alone have the strength to take on a Gastrea in one-on-one combat. But the very thing that gives them power is a ticking time bomb, so even as they protect humanity, they are also feared and shunned. Are they Girls? Monsters? Or Mankind's Ultimate Salvation?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

The newly-formed team even makes it to a tournament; however, their first match turns out to be their last when they are brutally squashed by the \"King of the Court,\" Tobio Kageyama. Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate.\n<br><br>\nThanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power.

Which means that, instead of getting a break after saving the world, newly changed magical girls Illya and Miyu have to help deal with the side-effects caused by the sealing of the Ley Cards. Still, that shouldn't be too hard, right? Wrong! Not only are the ley lines failing, but to make matters worse, Illya somehow ends up with a magical clone… and that sinister clone has plans of her own! Worse yet, since the \"dark\" version of herself is drawing its power from the same source as our heroine, Illya's own powers are being reduced proportionately. These are definitely not the kind of problems that the average girl should have to deal with.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Thanks to her late grandfather, Kobeni's been engaged to a total stranger since childhood, and even though she's supposedly met him she doesn't remember a single thing about him. Even weirder is that both her Mom and creepily over-doting sister, Benio, seem completely unsurprised when the groom-to-be, Hakuya, and his younger sister, Mashiro, show up on the family's doorstep to move in with them!<br>\n<br>\nBut it's not until they start attending Kobeni's school that things take an even stranger turn after she starts to pick up some very... unusual vibes from her potential future family. From Mashiro's obsession with aliens and UMAs (Unidentified Mysterious Animals) to Hakuya's disconcerting lack of emotion, there's something very off about them that Kobeni can't quite put her finger on. What has her grandfather gotten her into, and how does this relate to the strange gap in Kobeni's memory?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

You see, the Rabbit House is both a restaurant and a boarding house, and Cocoa will be working there along with the owner's granddaughter, Chino and the strangely military-obsessed Rize.

Still, there is something just a little odd about the Rabbit House. Besides the fact that Rize usually carries a Glock and a knife hidden on her, there's also a mystery involving the shop's pet rabbit, Tippy.

One day at the local arcade, he plays Oono Akira, a fellow classmate but who's popular, smart, pretty and a rich girl that absolutely destroys him at Street Fighter II.

Especially since she wants to go to Amagi Brilliant Park, where the rides are either dangerous or mind-numbingly dull and the only costumed performers who aren’t rude or apathetic are the ones who didn’t show up for work.<br>\n<br>\nSo when Isuzu asks Seiya to take over as the park’s new manager, he knows she’s crazy (Well, crazy-er, given the gunpoint thing.).  But when Seiya learns that Amagi Brilliant Park is a REAL Magic Kingdom, that the costumed performers aren’t wearing costumes, that they live off the energy created by attendees, and that unless they can attract 250,000 attendees in three months, they’ll lose their jobs and homes… he goes a little crazy himself.<br>\n<br>\nBut, even with the aid of scantily clad fairies, giant mice and sniper-trained sheep, can anyone rescue a park that’s sunk so low that its own bus doesn’t stop there anymore? The race is on to get the turnstiles turning and save Amagi Brilliant Park!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

However, they did not anticipate the species' remarkable ability to adapt. Now in the 26th century, a lethal disease known as the Alien Engine Virus has arrived on Earth, and the cure is suspected to be found only on Mars.

His sister has already died in the service of the Arandas military, and his secret reason for enlisting is to ferret out the truth behind her mysterious death. So, when a civilian convoy is in jeopardy and his own battle mech is destroyed, Susumu's all too ready to break ranks and jump into the cockpit of the experimental Argevollen. What he isn't expecting, however, is that activating the Argevollen conforms it to his mind alone. Now he's on the frontline of the ongoing meat-grinder that the war between Arandas and Ingelmia has become, and his only certain ally is an attractive civilian contractor whose reasons for being in the war are as convoluted as his own.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Okay, maybe that's not how it usually goes, but that's what happens when Chiyo Sakura finally gets up the nerve to tell her classroom crush Nozaki how she feels. Since she doesn't know that he's secretly a manga artist who publishes under a female pen name, and he doesn't know that she doesn't know, he misunderstands and offers her a chance to work as his assistant instead of a date! But while it's not flowers and dancing, it is a chance to get closer to him, so Chiyo gamely accepts. And when Nozaki realizes how useful Chiyo can be in figuring out what girls find romantic, he'll be spending even more time with her \"researching\" while remaining completely clueless. Could Chiyo's romantic frustration possibly get any more drawn out of proportion?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

This was all a part of the company’s plan to completely dominate their competitors and monopolize the industry.<br>\n<br>\nDan Amo works at the General Affairs department of Hyuga Corp. By day, he is a nondescript salaryman, but at night, he relishes the sense of fulfillment his motorcycling lifestyle brings him. However, when night comes to Route 246, a group of mysterious riders in black suits frequently appear, and a freelance journalist, Makina Mikage, is always on their tail. Another figure appears on the scene in Kotaro Hyuga, the heir to the Hyuga Corp. presidency.<br>\n<br>\nThe threads of an unescapable fate begin to draw these three young riders together...<br>\n<br>\n(Source: global.yamaha-motor.com/showroom/mt/story)",

He spends his days creating astounding pieces of art, from a giant-size Bodhidharma portrayed on a 180 square meter-wide sheet of paper, to a pair of sparrows painted on a tiny rice grain. Short-tempered, utterly sarcastic, with no passion for sake or money, he would charge a fortune for any job he is not really interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird of Tetsuzo's four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father's talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. \"We're father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecades later, Europe was going to discover the immense talent of Tetsuzo. He was to become best known by one of his many names: Katsushika Hokusai. He would mesmerize Renoir and van Gogh, Monet and Klimt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, very few today are even aware of the woman who assisted him all his life, and greatly contributed to his art while remaining uncredited. This is the untold story of O-Ei, Master Hokusai's daughter: a lively portrayal of a free-spirited woman overshadowed by her larger-than-life father, unfolding through the changing seasons.",

When a veteran labels his award-winning piece as \"unoriginal,\" Seishuu quickly loses his cool with severe repercussions. <br><br>\n\nAs punishment, and also in order to aid him in self-reflection, Seishuu's father exiles him to the Goto Islands, far from the comfortable Tokyo lifestyle the temperamental artist is used to. Now thrown into a rural setting, Seishuu must attempt to find new inspiration and develop his own unique art style—that is, if boisterous children (headed by the frisky Naru Kotoishi), fujoshi middle schoolers, and energetic old men stop barging into his house! The newest addition to the intimate and quirky Goto community only wants to get some work done, but the islands are far from the peaceful countryside he signed up for. Thanks to his wacky neighbors who are entirely incapable of minding their own business, the arrogant calligrapher learns so much more than he ever hoped to. <br><br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

Earth’s only line of defense is a mysterious group called the “Border” who are armed with weapons called “Triggers”.<br>\n <br>\nFour years later, the city has recovered from initial attacks and citizens of Mikado City have started to get used to the Neighbor’s attacks. Yuma Kuga, a transfer student, and his classmate Osamu Mikumo find themselves fighting a Neighbor that suddenly appears. Osamu, who is actually a Border agent, activates his Trigger but is unable to defeat it. This leaves Yuma to activate his own Trigger and defeat the alien. Yuma reveals that he is not part of Border and is actually a Neighbor who has transferred from the other side.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

Although nervous, Shidou accepts the offer. The two spend their time visiting a planetarium, buying food at the festival, and trying out a mock wedding ceremony. Meanwhile, Shidou's friends—Tohka Yatogami, Yoshino, and Kotori Itsuka—are looking for him, while also enjoying the festival themselves.<br>\n<br>\nAs Shidou spends the day with Kurumi, he begins to notice an unexpected softer side of her. He knows that Kurumi is infamously called the \"Worst Spirit,\" but the girl standing before him is a gentle soul. However, as the day draws to a close, Shirou finally begins to understand the truth behind it all.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: Unaired 11th episode of the TV series bundled with the third volume of Date A Live Encore.</i>",

They are also completely cut off from the outside world, keeping them sheltered and innocent. However, a problem has come up recently—more and more graduates are failing to cope with the modern world after graduation. To deal with this problem, they've decided to kidnap a male commoner student, and enroll him as a student. They hope that this will be a gentle way to introduce the girls to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagurazaka Kimito is chosen for this dubious honor, mostly because he seems utterly average. However, the school leaders also seem to have concluded he's a homosexual with a muscle fetish. When Kimito hears that the alternative may be castration (to protect the girls' purity), he eagerly plays along with this misconception. Now he'll just have to survive the attention of many high class young ladies that are completely out of touch with the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

Now, two years later, Aoi, Shizuka, Ema, Misa and Midori have learned the truth about the anime industry: it's not always fun, it's anything but easy, and having talent isn't always enough to open the right doors.<br>\n<br>\nWhich is why Aoi's overwhelmed by her job as a production assistant, Shizuka's waiting on tables between auditions, Midori's currently scriptless, Misa's switched to C.G., and Ema's working long hours as a key animator. Is it what they imagined? No. But are they ready to give up? Not just yet! Sometimes, when things happen in animation, they can happen in the most wonderful ways!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Her meddling with her succubus Artemis and incubus Priapos has caught the attention of the heavens, and so the Archangel Michael issues an edict. When Maria loses her virginity, she will also lose her magical powers. A beautiful angel named Ezekiel is supposed to watch Maria and make sure the witch does not use magic in front of people, but Maria continues to use magic anyways.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Mikado Ryuugamine is now one step closer to his goal of living an exciting life, and in turn, delves deeper into the darker side of Ikebukuro. After gaining absolute control over a former rival, he uses his newfound power as he pleases, purging the Dollars from the inside to mold it into the ideal organization. This proves to be as challenging as it sounds as Mikado must now deal with unwanted outside interference, most notably a re-emerging and dearly missed friend. Meanwhile, Izaya Orihara still has some schemes up his sleeve, although a rival information exchange center has proven to be quite the hindrance, lurking within everyone’s favorite downtown district. Undoubtedly, sooner or later, chaos will strike again.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

However, this new method of warfare is about to be turned on its head.<br></br>\n\nQwenthur Barbotage, a student studying Object Design, and Havia Winchell, a radar analyst of noble birth, serve in the Legitimate Kingdom's 37th Mobile Maintenance Battalion, tasked with supporting the Baby Magnum, one of the nation's Objects. Unfortunately, a battle gone awry places the duo in a precarious situation: mere infantry stand face-to-face against the unfathomable might of an enemy Object. As they scramble to save themselves and their fellow soldiers, a glimmer of hope shines through, and the world's perception of Objects is changed forever.<br></br>\n\nHeavy Object follows these two soldiers alongside Milinda Brantini, the Baby Magnum's pilot, and their commanding officer Frolaytia Capistrano as the unit treks all over the globe to fight battle after battle. Facing one impossible situation after another, they must summon all their wit and courage to overcome the insurmountable foes that are Objects.<br></br>\n",

However, the only ones who were strong enough to defeat him were the Tenkai Knights: Bravenwolf, Tributon, Valorn and Lydendor. Facing defeat, Vilius unleashed the mighty Tenkai Dragon, who was later defeated by the four Knights and its fragments were scattered across the planet. These heroes were never seen again, but the Corrupted have returned more powerful than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on planet Earth in the year 2034, four teenage humans named Guren, Ceylan, Toxsa, and Chooki find an interdimensional portal to Quarton where they are chosen by the Guardians to become the new generation of Tenkai Knights and prevent Vilius to take control of both worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

At this point, the movie diverges into one of 4 routes depending on what the audience chooses. Each route recaps different aspects of the previous Pretty Rhythm series, mainly reintroducing the different characters and their performances. However, Laala and friends only get a chance to enter one door at a time, meaning the film must be watched four times to view each door choice.\n<br><br>\n(Sources: PriPara Wikia and Wikipedia)",

Koyomi noticed a change on his body “that could not be overlooked” and sought advice from Shinobu Oshino leading him to contact Yozuru Kagenui and Yotsugi Ononoki. Was this change signifying retribution for everything that Koyomi has done?!\n<br><br>\n(Source: Aniplex)",

Others come to test their skills against the legions of monsters lurking in the darkness below. However, Bell Cranel’s grandfather told him a different reason: it’s a great place to rescue (and subsequently meet) girls! Now that Bell’s a dungeon delver himself, the ladies he’s encountering aren’t the helpless damsels in distress he’d imagined, and one of them, the beautiful swordswoman Ais Wallenstein, keeps rescuing Bell instead. As embarrassing as that is, it’s nothing compared to what happens when goddesses get involved. Freya, Hephaistos, and Loki, with their powerful Familias, are intimidating enough, but there’s one goddess whose relationship with Bell is certain to spark trouble.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

To Decim, judgment has always been black and white—that is—until he meets a mysterious young woman whose fate seems impossible to decide.

Or learning that if you can't re-possess your physical shell, you'll trigger a panty-fueled apocalypse that will wipe out all life on the planet? For Yuta Iridatsu, it's just the start of the worst out-of-body experience ever. Now, if his dissed disembodied spirit doesn't pursue the persuasions of a porn-obsessed paranormal pussycat and purloin a missing mystical manual, a meteor will collide with Earth! And to stack the odds even further, the book is hidden somewhere in the boarding house Yuta shares with a bevy of beautiful babes, but if he gets an eyeful of his ravishing co-renters in their unmentionables before he's back in himself, it's flash-forward to Doomsday! Will the literal end of the world be wearing briefs, a bikini, or a thong?

Instead, her murder on stage by an unknown assassin only served to increase the tension between the two countries. Already a country known for its incredibly low crime rate, East Doroa increases security in preparation for war--but security is nothing to the likes of super-genius thief Lupin III!<br>\n<br>\nStill, when he and partner Jigen Daisuke swipe the Little Comet gemstone from an embassy in East Doroa, it's a little convenient that the police seem to know their every move. And worse, before they can even make their getaway, the pair find themselves under the crosshairs of a certain hitman--the same one that killed Queen Malta! Something's fishy, and in order to confirm his suspicions, Jigen visits the cemetery. There, he finds himself staring at his own gravestone. It's a calling card of the sniper, Yael Okuzaki... and no one targeted by him has ever escaped the grave! But why is he only after Jigen, and not Lupin? And things only get more complicated with Fujiko around!\n<br><br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)",

        "description": "Gintoki, Shinpachi, and Kagura return as the fun-loving but broke members of the Yorozuya team! Living in an alternate-reality Edo, where swords are prohibited and alien overlords have conquered Japan, they try to thrive on doing whatever work they can get their hands on. However, Shinpachi and Kagura still haven't been paid... Does Gin-chan really spend all that cash playing pachinko?\n\nMeanwhile, when Gintoki drunkenly staggers home one night, an alien spaceship crashes nearby. A fatally injured crew member emerges from the ship and gives Gintoki a strange, clock-shaped device, warning him that it is incredibly powerful and must be safeguarded. Mistaking it for his alarm clock, Gintoki proceeds to smash the device the next morning and suddenly discovers that the world outside his apartment has come to a standstill. With Kagura and Shinpachi at his side, he sets off to get the device fixed; though, as usual, nothing is ever that simple for the Yorozuya team.\n\nFilled with tongue-in-cheek humor and moments of heartfelt emotion, Gintama's fourth season finds Gintoki and his friends facing both their most hilarious misadventures and most dangerous crises yet.\n\n<br></br>(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

The first episode will be a 60 minute special that will air at the end of march.\n<br><br>\nHaving attended Mihama Academy for about a year, Yuuji Kazami has seemingly found his place within the school, but he suddenly decides to pursue a promotion in CIRS. After consulting JB about his intentions, they both thoroughly examine Yuuji's documents and dissect the events of his upbringing to determine if the job is fit for him.\n<br><br>\nMeanwhile, unbeknownst to the two, the girls of Mihama uncover some torn documents in Yuuji's room. After restoring the papers, they discover the story that has formed—or perhaps broken—Yuuji into the man he is today. However, what was thought to be history has haunted him to the present, and the chains of the past begin to drag him back into the darkness...\n",

Rookie seiyuu Futaba Ichinose must learn about the hard work, determination, and heart that goes into being the voice behind beloved characters. The work is far from easy and nothing hurts more than the dreaded rejection call, but Futaba works through it to achieve her dream of becoming a big-time seiyuu - except she only has two years to prove to her agency that she's good enough to be one. Luckily, she's not alone! Ichigo Moesaki, a self-claimed princess from Planet Strawberry, and Rin Kohana, a seasoned professional since the age of five, will be at her side when they form the seiyuu unit, Earphones. But even being in a unit won't be enough to guarantee Futaba's success if she can't land more roles. Follow these three girls and learn just what it takes to be a professional voice actor.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Funimation)",

After all, how many cafés have waitresses who collect firearms and a rabbit that actually talks? However, trouble may be burrowing into the Kafuu residence when a magazine runs an article on places to eat and neglects to mention Rabbit House! Will an investigation into what’s been “haunting” Syaro’s house be a wild goose chase, or will someone get a lot of grey hare as a result? Is the sudden appearance of Cocoa’s big sister a blessing or a disaster waiting happen? Still, nothing is as scary as the prospect of graduating school!

Unfortunately, it was broken and did not move. <br>\nMisaki finds out that this watch originally belonged to her grandfather. It was her grandfather who gave it to her father. They both worked at the Tokyo Station.<br>\nMisaki's father was always strict and severe, especially to her. That was the only memory she would remember about him. She regrets how they could not connect with each other because she could not communicate with him very well when she was in her teens. <br>\nMisaki visits the Tokyo station, hoping to repair this memorable watch. However, the repair shop was already gone. <br>\nShe drops her shoulders and walks on the platform of the station. Suddenly, she finds a station employee who looks just like her father. <br>\nShe runs and follows this person without even thinking...<br>\n<br>\n(Source: YouTube)",

Thanks to the \"Cultural Exchange Between Species Act,\" these once-mythical creatures have assimilated into society, or at least, they're trying.<br>\n<br>\nWhen a hapless human teenager named Kurusu Kimihito is inducted as a \"volunteer\" into the government exchange program, his world is turned upside down.

Yukina crosses blades with the enormous man who's pursuing her, but before the fight can escalate further, La Folia makes a shocking comment: \"Father, this is the Fourth Progenitor, Akatsuki Kojou... my first!\" La Folia's father, Lucas, had told her to decide who she wished to marry, so she declares that Kojou is her choice. Lucas refuses to accept this, but then La Folia's mother, Polifonia, invites Kojou and Yukina to a party so they can all talk in more detail. When they arrive at the party, they discover that Asagi, Yaze, Nagisa, and Sayaka have been invited as well, due to their connections with Kojou. What sort of heated battle is about to break out between the many girls in Kojou's life?!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

The academy has a group of the three students with the highest grades in the musical department, and they are known as the Kao Kai (Cherry Blossom Flower Association). This organization stands at the top of the pecking order within the academy.<br>\n<br>\nThe shortcut to entering the musical department is to enter the Star Frame class, which is directly taught by the members, and to be recognized by them. Unfortunately, due to their own problems, students Tōru, Kaito, Shou, Shuu, and Yuuta are all struggling to even remain candidates for the musical department. By a stroke of luck, however, the five are spotted by Kao Kai member Ootori, and they pique his interest.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Depressed and traumatized after failing to rescue his friend, he has decided to forsake his mad scientist alter ego and live as an ordinary college student. Surrounded by friends who know little of his time travel experiences, Okabe spends his days trying to forget the horrors of his adventures alone.<br>\n<br>\nWhile working as a receptionist at a college technology forum, Okabe meets the short, spunky Maho Hiyajo, who\nlater turns out to be the interpreter at the forum's presentation, conducted by Professor Alexis Leskinen. In front of a stunned crowd, Alexis and Maho unveil Amadeus—a revolutionary AI capable of storing a person's memories and creating a perfect simulation of that person complete with their personality and quirks. Meeting with Maho and Alexis after the presentation, Okabe learns that the two were Kurisu's colleagues in university, and that they have simulated her in Amadeus. Hired by Alexis to research the simulation's behavior, Okabe is given the chance to interact with the shadow of a long-lost dear friend. Dangerously tangled in the past, Okabe must face the harsh reality and carefully maneuver around the disastrous consequences that come with disturbing the natural flow of time.\n",

Throwing himself fully into his career as a teacher limited his opportunities for much else in life. Now in his thirties, love has finally entered his world thanks to one of his students, Sae Inagaki. Smart, athletic, and devoted, Sae’s initial proposition to cook for Youichi quickly transitioned into her declaring her love and affection for him. Though their positions as teacher and student make their love forbidden, Youichi is determined to teach his student and now girlfriend a great deal about human sexuality.\n<br><br>\nThe second episode features Youichi in a different setting of Shoujo Kyouiku, this time with the young photography student, Asami Hinada. All those years of longing for love helped foster a great deal of sexual kinks within Youichi. Will Asami be able to embrace him despite them? Or perhaps she’ll love him because of them?",

By infecting humans with its bite, the monster can create aggressive and undead creatures known as Kabane. On the island Hinomoto, located in the far east, people have built stations to shelter themselves from these creatures. People access the station, as well as transport wares between them, with the help of a locomotive running on steam, called Hayajiro. Ikoma, a boy who lives in the Aragane station and helps to build Hayajiro, creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu in order to defeat the creatures. One day, as he waits for an opportunity to use his weapon, he meets a girl named Mumei, who is excused from the mandatory Kabane inspection. During the night, Ikoma meets Mumei again as he sees Hayajiro going out of control. The staff on the locomotive has turned into the creatures. The station, now under attack by Kabane, is the opportunity Ikoma has been looking for.\n",

But as more Classicaloids continue to arrive, can the town withstand the combined creative energies of dozens of musical geniuses all determined to promote their own creative output?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

They were helpless to fight against them and resigned themselves to imminent death. At that time, an ultimate weapon which could create items out of imagination was discovered in a expansive cave under Japan, along with its young master Ryuusei who was in cryostasis. The indiscriminate alien attacks awoke him and he led the humans to a decisive victory.<br>\n<br>\nOne year later, while the areas which had been destroyed by the aliens were still being rebuilt, Ryuusei was appointed as the commander of the newly-formed Defence Force of Earth, which was created to fight against space invaders. However, he was the only person who could use the ‘imagination embodiment device’. If something was to happen to him, then calamity would befall the world. So the Defence Force of Earth decided to recruit girls with potential to fight alongside him. Even though they hesitated at first, they each had their own reasons to join Ryuusei. Thus, the special force ‘Blade Briders’ was formed, to protect the Earth against the aliens who have returned.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Visual Novel Database)",

The ground was collapsed and polluted, and many kinds of plants and animals became extinct. The earth encountered the 6th mass extinction: The Big Six. During the time, humans built the aero police to save endangered species. In this isolated city in the sky, various animals evolved over the years through genetically modified mating. As a result, they started walking on two legs and acquired language. Today, they have built a civilization and lead peaceful lives.

        "description": "In 2022, the world of virtual reality was upended by the arrival of a new invention from a genius programmer, Akihiko Kayaba. Called NerveGear, it was the first full-dive system and with it, came endless possibilities to VRMMORPGs.<br><br>\n\nIn 2026, a new machine called the Augma is developed to compete against the NerveGear and its successor, the Amusphere. A next-gen wearable device, the Augma doesn't have a full-dive function like its predecessors. Instead, it uses Augmented Reality to get players into the game. It is safe, user-friendly and lets users play while they are conscious, making it an instant hit on the market. The most popular game on the system is “Ordinal Scale” (aka: OS), an ARMMORPG developed exclusively for the Augma.<br><br>\n\nAsuna and the gang have already been playing OS for a while, by the time Kirito decides to join them. They’re about to find out that Ordinal Scale isn’t all fun and games…<br><br>\n\n(Source: Official website)",

One day, Sonosaki tells her classmate Katsuhira: \"You have been selected to be a Kiznaiver.\" The Kizuna System, which allows Katsuhira to share his wounds, connects him to the classmates whose lives and personalities completely differ from his. The Kizuna System is an incomplete system for the implementation of world peace that connects people through wounds. All those who are connected to this system are called Kiznaivers. When one Kiznaiver is wounded, the system divides and transmits the wound among the other Kiznaivers.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

However, in late December 2022 with no release, Yamaga was still described as \"currently working\" on the project.",

She performs as an idol like Kokona Saionji (her classmate and close friend) and Tsukasa Kisaragi (an idol who dresses in male clothing). However, unlike Kokona whose popularity is skyrocketing and Tsukasa with her charisma in male attire, Komugi's only gigs are low-end ones like those at the local shopping district. Still, Komugi has her \"dream\" as she lives her dual lives as a idol and a middle school girl.<br>\n<br>\nOne day, a mysterious injured creature named Usa-P appears before Komugi. Komugi gives Usa-P medical treatment, and Usa-P, in consideration of Komugi's kindness, asks if she wants to be a Legendary Girl who can use magical powers.<br>\n<br>\nHaving become a reluctant Legendary Girl, Komugi battles strange masked figures who suddenly appear! As a newly deemed Magical Nurse, she fights still more waves of masked figures. Meanwhile, a Magical Maid, a Magical Sister, and more also appear to make it a three-way battle!? Can Komugi handle the three roles of middle school girl, idol, and Magical Nurse? And, what lies ahead in these battles and her \"dream\" …!?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Now humanity has lost access to the city's controls, and is hunted down and purged by the defense system known as the Safeguard. In a tiny corner of the city, a little enclave known as the Electro-Fishers is facing eventual extinction, trapped between the threat of the Safeguard and dwindling food supplies. A girl named Zuru goes on a journey to find food for her village, only to inadvertently cause doom when an observation tower senses her and summons a Safeguard pack to eliminate the threat. With her companions dead and all escape routes blocked, the only thing that can save her now is the sudden arrival of Killy the Wanderer, on his quest for the Net Terminal Genes, the key to restoring order to the world.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Official Website)",

When he uses his ability, it causes him to be able to see girls naked and also makes them horny. If the daemons aren’t defeated, then their lust will cause the whole school to become an orgy. As part of the public morals committee, he can’t let that happen!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Hau~ Omochikaeri!)",

Yuuki moved to this snowy town to help his grandparents shovel snow at their home, the former boarding house Yamanouchi-sou. He met many warm-hearted people, including the shrine maiden Sayuki who worries about her inability to properly greet strangers, his mysterious but playful housemate and senpai Mizuki, and the local cafe’s cheerful and energetic kouhai mascot Koharu. Even though he was still feeling lost, he tried to get used to living in this snowy land. During that time, his grandfather suggested that he find love while he is still young and lead a new life in earnest. Now’s the time for him to take the first step and fall in love.<br>",

However, many Promin who have turned into bugs known as \"Bugmin\" are responsible for many of the world's real-life bugs. Left alone, they may eventually turn into a big problem. The boy Yūto encounters the space dog Wanda, and the pair use a camera-like device and key items to capture Bugmin. Promin themselves are able to do things like \"accelerate objects,\" \"spew fire,\" or \"create objects,\" through an ability known as \"Kamiwaza\" (miracle), and are able to fend off Bugmin with it. At first, the Bugmin only cause small, bothersome things, but it will soon elevate into a global scale threat. Can one boy and one dog save the world?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Another power, the evil dragon Daganzord, also resides on the continent, and no one is powerful enough to stop him from spreading destruction and charred land in his wake. Two individuals, Bairo and Kismitete, undertook a ritual alongside a party of wizards to seal Daganzord, but were foiled. This event was known thereafter as the Balbagoa Tragedy. Bairo and Kismitete's son Hiiro is saved by Giiru, and Hiiro swears to avenge his parents' deaths and trains himself with the sword. When Hiiro turns 16, he sets out on a journey to slay the dragon, and Giruu accompanies him, having no choice. Along the way, they meet many types of people, and gain companions on their journey.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

However, due an endless series of misunderstandings, Handa perceives the worship he receives from his legions of fans as bullying, leading the school's idol to shut himself off from the rest of his classmates.<br>\n<br>\nBut distancing himself from his peers doesn't deter them from adoring him; in fact, his attempts at drawing attention away from himself often end up unintentionally converting even the most skeptical of students into believers.

Although her high school life is relatively unremarkable, her career as a member of the military organization S.O.N.G. is anything but. Using powerful, ancient armor known as Symphogear, Hibiki and her teammates work with the United Nations to deal with international disputes and disasters.<br>\n<br>\nDuring a mission briefing at headquarters, Hibiki is made aware of a mysterious organization known as the Bavarian Illuminati, who has been responsible for several major disasters in the past and currently operate in the war-torn country Val Verde. Together, Hibiki and her team infiltrate one of the Bavarian Illuminati's manufacturing plants and free hundreds of slaves. Exposed, alchemists Saint-Germain, Cagliostro, and Prelati reveal themselves as the organization's top brass, and—using alchemical powers—declare a global revolution while sacrificing thousands of lives. Faced with yet another threat to the world's survival, Hibiki and her allies must confront the Bavarian Illuminati in their most difficult and destructive battle yet.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

        "description": "Hanabi has loved her older friend Narumi for years, but she’s still in high school and not only is Narumi now her new homeroom teacher, he’s also clearly in love with the music teacher, Akane. And as awkward as being the unwanted third in a romantic triangle can be, things become even more twisted for Hanabi when she learns that another student, Mugi, is in love with Akane. That leads to a strange idea: since the ones that Mugi and Hanabi are in love with aren’t available, the two unrequited thirds start to explore the idea of becoming each other’s substitute surrogate relationship. It’s not about romance, of course. Just sex and convenience.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

As the Irousu roam the conquered lands, mankind has been driven back, but there’s one last weapon that may still turn the tide: super-powered schoolgirls! At schools like the Shinjugamine Girls Academy, elite classes of Star Guardians alternate between regular schoolwork and learning to kick Irousu behind. It’s a duty that the members of the Shinjugamine Hoshimori force, like freshman Miki Hoshitsuki, take seriously, but as they’re basically normal girls who just happen to get their powers from a magic tree, there are normal life issues they have to contend with as well. With the arrival of their latest mysterious recruit, however, things are about to get deadly serious.<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Kokone should be diligently studying for her university entrance exams, but she just can't seem to stay awake. Aside from stealing precious study time, her napping is even more distracting, as it brings on strange dreams with warring machines that hint at family secrets that have been dormant for years. She can't ask her father, a hipster mechanic more talented and artful than his job requires, as he's always busy modifying motorcycles and cars in flights of fancy. What are these visions that lead Kokone at once closer to and farther away from her family? Like all the best anime, the film revels in multilayered fantasy to show how sometimes opposites—waking and dreaming, the past and the future—are far more intertwined than they appear.<br><br>\n\n(Source: New York International Children's Film Festival)",

Born into great wealth, she was a princess of the highest pedigree–until she was cut off by the leader of the Akagami Foundation. For the last five years, she's lived on Feather Island with her maids. But she hasn't been alone. She has invited the best minds Japan has to offer to come and stay with her.<br>\n<br>\nAnd so nineteen-year-old college student Ii-chan and his best friend, computer genius Kunagisa Tomo, find themselves as Iria’s guests at her elaborate mansion. Surrounded by fascinating women – a chef, a fortune-teller, a scholar, and an artist, not to mention his own friend Tomo – Ii-chan is feeling a little overmatched intellectually. But the sudden discovery of a grisly murder sends the island into shock. And Ii-chan discovers that he does possess a bit of genius: the ability to discover what is real and what is fake, who is who they claim to be and who is a killer.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Del Rey Manga)",

        "description": "To the average person, psychic abilities might seem a blessing; for Kusuo Saiki, however, this couldn't be further from the truth. Gifted with a wide assortment of supernatural abilities ranging from telepathy to x-ray vision, he finds this so-called blessing to be nothing but a curse. As all the inconveniences his powers cause constantly pile up, all Kusuo aims for is an ordinary, hassle-free life—a life where ignorance is bliss.<br><br>\n\n\nUnfortunately, the life of a psychic is far from quiet. Though Kusuo tries to stay out of the spotlight by keeping his powers a secret from his classmates, he ends up inadvertently attracting the attention of many odd characters, such as the empty-headed Riki Nendou and the delusional Shun Kaidou. Forced to deal with the craziness of the people around him, Kusuo comes to learn that the ordinary life he has been striving for is a lot more difficult to achieve than expected.<br><br>\n<i>Note: Aired in 2 versions, a 120-episode 5-minute short series, and a combined 24-episode 24-minute TV series with the same content.</i>",

        "description": "At the far end of the Southern Seas, where none had dared to go, there exists an island called Charanpo Land. At the center of that island is a giant baobab tree, which produces many eggs each day. Inside the eggs are food, clothing, and other daily necessities. The inhabitants of the island live carefree lives, dependent upon the eggs.<br>\n<br>\nBut lately, more and more of the eggs have been turning up empty, which makes the inhabitants uneasy. Then one day, with a thunderous crash, and an explosion of rainbow-colored light, the baobab tree produces an egg of curious appearance. The next morning, the village chief Poncho tells the inhabitants that they must find that egg. Now the tiger Kometora and a group of children must find the egg within the forest.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)\n<br>\n<br>\nPart of the 2017 Anime Tamago Projects.",

Ever since being separated from her mother in early childhood, Matoi has been entrusted to her grandparents on her father's side, but three months ago, she finally began to live with her father Shingo. In those circumstances, she only wishes for a peaceful, normal life.<br><br>\n\nHer close friend and part-time workmate Yuma Kusanagi is part of the family of the shrine's chief priest, and is a candidate to be the successor shrine maiden. For generations, her family has performed exorcisms of evil spirits. She invites Matoi to one of these exorcism ceremonies, a so-called \"Divine Possession\" that she will attempt.<br><br>\n\nOne day, Matoi and Yuma walk from the school to the shrine as usual, but when they arrive, they are greeted by the shrine's now damaged grounds, and Yuma's parents have both collapsed from their wounds. Matoi's father Shingo, a police detective, launches an investigation, and he comes upon a man who does not seem entirely sane: his only witness. When he holds down the man, Yuma begins the ritual of Divine Possession.<br><br>\n\nSomething strange then happens, not with Yuma, but with Matoi. Matoi Sumeragi, who had only wanted a normal, peaceful life, takes the role of a god, and gains the power to banish evil spirits! To get her precious everyday life back, Matoi must conduct exorcisms!\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

        "description": "Ares no Tenbin depicts an alternative canon following the events of the first season of the original Inazuma Eleven anime. Taking place sometime after Raimon's victory in the Football Frontier, in this alternative universe, the alien attack from the second season never occurs. Japanese soccer has been deemed weak compared to international competition. Due to this, the Raimon Eleven have been disbanded, and its members are sent to different soccer teams across Japan in the hopes of strengthening Japan's soccer at a national level. Moreover, in the modern world of Japanese youth soccer, sponsorship has become a vital aspect of a team's survival. A youth team must have a sponsor, otherwise, their club will face disbandment, and are not permitted to partake in matches.<br><br>\n\nThe series focuses on the forward Asuto Inamori and his team, Inakuni Raimon, which is made up of players from the remote Inakunijima Island. They have replaced the original Raimon Eleven as Raimon Junior High's soccer team, and are competing as underdogs in the annual Football Frontier youth tournament.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Wikpedia)",

        "description": "The film Ao Oni The Animation will be closer to the traditional mystery horror of the original game, although it will have a new story that is different from the original game, novelization, and live-action films.<br><br>\n\nThe story takes place in a suburban town by a mountain forest. The five members of the high school's folklore research club are trying to think of ideas for the culture festival when they discover a former member's collection of research notes from 40 years ago. The legend described in the notes resembles a popular free game called \"Ao Oni,\" so they choose the game as their culture festival theme. They are able to meet with the game's creator, but shortly afterward the creator dies mysteriously. The club members are investigating the mystery at the school when the door shuts and they find themselves locked inside.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Anime News Network)",
